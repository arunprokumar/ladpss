Search Bar (v1)
====
Search Bar written in HTL.

## Features

### Use Object
The Search Bar component uses the `com.adobe.cq.wcm.core.components.models.Searchbar` Sling model as its Use-object.

### Edit Dialog Properties
The following properties are written to JCR for the Search Bar component and are expected to be available as `Resource` properties:

1. `./hideButton` - shows or hides "Search" button.
2. `./resultpage` - result page path used for redirection

## Client Libraries
The component provides a `core.wcm.components.search.searchbar.v1` client library category that contains a recommended base
CSS styling and JavaScript component. It should be added to a relevant site client library using the `embed` property.
